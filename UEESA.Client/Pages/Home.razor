                        <h2>How did Star Athenaeum come to be and what is it?</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Star Aether Project came to be almost exactly a year after Stryxus became a part of the Star Citizen community on the 20th October 2020. It was seen as a need because of the
                            ever growing inconsistencies and decentralisation that came with the ever growing amount of tools for Star Ciitzen scattered across many sites, so with vast programming skills, Stryxus decided to attempt 
                            to fix this - The Star Aether Project was born. Star Aether was named after its ambitious project Star Gazer.
                            <br />
                            The Star Aether project is a vast amount of ever increasing centralised tools exclusively for Star Citizen! Each tool is individually tailored to in its own way using unique systems as well as those systems
                            working together. The tools provided range from the ambitions Google Earth-esk project of Star Gazer which contains the full star system network of Star Citizen with many micro details, to the smaller
                            service status detector which can notify you on your personalised selection of status changes.
